This is my webpage project built on bootstrap adding in carousel and accordian
elements.

To start it just open the index file and you can navigate from there using
the nav bar at the top

The forms are not functional and do not save to anywhere but they are there.

I have done all of my prep-work in Figma which can be found here...

As for the video, you can select it and then GoLive which will populate a tab
in your browser to watch that as well.
